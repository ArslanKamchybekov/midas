## 💡 Inspiration
In a world where financial literacy often feels like an arcane art, we drew inspiration from the legendary King Midas. Just as he turned everything he touched into gold, we wanted to create a tool that transforms confusing financial data into golden insights. Our mission is to democratize financial wisdom and make prosperity accessible to everyone, not through a mythical touch, but through the power of modern technology and intelligent systems.
